I forgot to put it
I forgot to wake you up this morning
I forgot to put the key
I am the first man
I'm your darling
I was the one who chose you to be my wife
I was the one who broke the glass.
I am the one who will uphold your name
I was the one who was wrong
I am the one who is worthy to be baptized

I'm disgusted with him, he ruined my life
I just lost my love for you
I'm hungry for the grave
I am fluent in Batak language
I let you go sincerely, I hope you and he are happy
I want to move
I'm wearing a red shirt
I greeted me wrong
I made a beautiful flower bloom that looks like you
I made a story about a baby trying to find its mother
I gave up love for the sake of freedom
I gave up love for freedom
I hate you but I love you
I exhale
I put a chair next to a tall cupboard close to him
I saw you again looking radiant

I dragged along whose mind I knew was still filled with that seed
I looked at the crowd
. I looked at him closely
I'm in a relationship with you
I'm used to using my heart, to partner, please don't hurt me
I stepped on a fish
I stepped on my left foot
I follow my heart
I said I don't understand
I looked around me again
I turned
I review the main pages to remember what I have learned
I glanced at the surroundings
I wandered off first
I feel calm
I thought to myself
I feel like I'm the same as other men, just lust
I feel beautiful when I wear this ulos
I feel reluctant when talking to people like you
I feel lonely. let's chat
I feel lazy to go home
I felt everyone applauded after seeing my mistake.
I feel lonely
I feel like I'm at a safe point
I feel useless being a boy
I feel uninspired today
I felt very devastated by the departure of the person I liked and cared about
I feel my body is getting stronger
I felt a drop of water fall from my right eyelid
I feel like I have failed as a woman if my mother is hurt
I feel cheated
I feel called to preserve the Batak language
I felt disconnected from the earth
I felt devastated
I shrugged
I handed him the money
I submitted some questions that I found to
I tell them
I put on the mask again and went to see you
I admire, not love
I looked for articles on thoughts about facing exams on
I am looking for a pastor for discussion, not a congregation
I ate with him
I eat little to stay slim
I cried hearing this song
I cry wailing for you oh God
I cried, unable to hold back my jealousy
I understand
I'm on standby there
I cut it first in the field
I look forward to your arrival

I swallowed hard at this sight that music could possibly enter the wonders of the world
I gulped, this was a sight that could possibly be numbered in the wonders of the world
I swallowed hard
I obey darling
I obeyed his orders
I invite you with joy
I smell stupidity about to happen
I'm trying to find out if they might have taken a hint
I tried drawing
I tried writing
I try to be sincere about loss, and smile from pain
I am an evil and sinful human being
I am independent and wasted
I accept all the shortcomings for today and forever

You're such a scared person

you are our protector
You go first, I'll follow later
whether you are a woman or a man, please explain
You pay attention so that nothing is the same
Why do you keep him? We still don't approve of your relationship
you are my partner
you deserve to have it
you are also married
Then you get up and move to another horizon
You are silent because your longing doesn't hit home
You are silent because your longing is unrequited
you too, don't call me old man
you're spoiled
You think it's easy to get rid of acne
You think this is your ancestor's stall
Are you sure whether you are Muslim?
You are the idol of my heart that I always long for

You have a hoe I don't want to borrow
do you have a hoe don't you

You want to get a gift too

You don't want to satisfy me, I want to feel your big penis
don't you want to eat my nose?
do you want to be my girlfriend?
You want to pass the disease on to your child, right?
you want to have intercourse
you want bread
you want to be my partner
You just want to discuss it with me, grandfather, I'm not in your class
Do you want to write in a letter if we want to break up, honey?
What ticket do you want to order for going home?
do you want to go to church to pray?
what color do you want?
Watch your language, friend, because what you say can affect you back
You take good care of yourself and teach me as a people
I thought I never knew you and me
you're fussy
Just make sure your sleep is important, okay?
you are crazy except me
are you crazy?
you came to attack when we were hurt
You're ugly, you're crazy, you look like a monkey
you are ugly and not smart
You're bad at singing again
you are ugly as a rat
you are the only one in my heart
You yourself have hidden secrets
Once you lie, no one will ever believe you again
you should make sure
you should say thank you
you just sleep first
You misinterpreted a statement
You're threatening the wrong person
you're bald huh?
You are the same age as my wife

you're like a drain
you're like a frog
you are like a snake and cunning and venomous
you are like a cunning and poisonous snake

The year you were born means we are the same age
you look like a bagong
you look like a horse
you wake up a sleeping crocodile, feel it for yourself
you ask me?
you're hard to understand
Where did you live yesterday, friend?
You abandoned our child to cover up your behavior and were forced to agree
What are you doing? Why have not you fallen asleep yet?
you're far away from the other side
If you call someone else, it's definitely my turn to undress
you lost to me
you are worthy of worship
You are even more beautiful now darling
you look first
You must be strong to face everything
You must be tired today, can I accompany you?
You must be tired, can I always be with you?
You must be very tired. Can I accompany you?
You plant wounds as well as what you get
you look strong on the outside
You seem very oblivious
you look so skinny and tan
You are like the moon that always lights me up every night
you are like the dew in the morning
you are special
You trip over your friend's things lying on the floor
You're out of luck now
you pooped your pants
are you selling or not?
you are my future my love
you are impressive
You're cute when you wear a peci
If you send me a photo of your breasts, I'll give you money
You send a photo of your breasts
you send a declaration of war
you are always in my memory
You remain faithful in ensuring that we do not need anything
You are always in my heart forever
You always make me want to stay
Of course you won't refuse my offer, right?
you're like a wild boar
you are like a sheep
You're like a dependent monkey
you're like a terrible devil
you are like twilight, beautiful to look at, longing to wait.
You are like the moon, beautiful but difficult to reach
you are like a pigeon
you're like an anus
you are like a dung floating in a river....
You are God, our shepherd, guide us, your sheep
are you serious about me?
Are you native Batak, or Batak from Kalimantan?
You focus on your dream period, hopefully we meet it at the best point
You focus on your dream time

You can only avoid the discussion
It seems like it's just wishful thinking all this time
just waiting for God's goodness to come, that's enough
just waiting for God's goodness to come,
it's just a pity that his older brother doesn't
It's just me and the tree. The leaves are sour and used as an additional seasoning for fish dishes
only me and my God know what is in my heart right now
I'm the only one who wants to have trouble with you
only in groups or even only in groups
just a coward

only your appearance is beautiful but your heart is rotten
I can only look at it when this longing comes

I can only pray for you from a distance, sir

can only understand
I can only rub my chest and be patient

Only you can change my world

I only sing this song from my heart for Mama

only when needed and wanted, after that it's either yes or no
I see little more of you than before
I've only seen a little of you
Just because of your hobby of hunting, you slaughtered all the protected animals
only memories remain
just limited to evening entertainment
just admiring you
just love
only limited
only the sound of crickets could be heard
only memory remains
only mother's prayers are the most effective
only visible from the surname
only interested in one woman
only time will tell
It's all just a gift from God
Only to Jesus I surrender all my worries
only his wishes are followed
only in God hope
only God is eternal refuge
Only God Jesus can separate us
only God is our mainstay in other countries

Distance is not a barrier for us to unite
Distance is not a barrier to our relationship
dream distance
Distance is only a barrier, not a separation
the distance between us cannot be filled
the distance is too far apart
leaking hose
That distance stabbed the longing I harbored

Among protected animals there are only hundreds providing a few objects
between the two of us

love me without erasing
love is when you find a good person
love is making ourselves hurt if we double our love for ourselves
love is a fertilizer that will
love is a different religion
Honey, pick me up and take me away from this muddy place
love is not found but determined through the will to build.
my love was rejected
love arises from habit
Love can fade but affection does not fade
great darling
Love is tested by distance if it can pass the beautiful gift
self-love over struggle
it's a shame it's torn
darling, can you pick it?
his love
sadly
love your knees is bullshit
Our love is getting more and more estranged, it's not like it used to be
Our love is getting more and more tenuous
Our love is forbidden by our parents
Our love is blocked by distance and time
your love at first sight
My love for you is three kilos minus a quarter
My love is like the coffee you brew
my love is like coffee
my unrequited love
My love is one sided
My love is hindered by your father's blessing
love begins with enmity
Love is seen from the heart, not from wealth
Love is with the person, not with the wealth
love is like gall
Love between different religions will last because it is helped by two gods
Love is like a fight that is always unclear
love does require sacrifice
darling is worth more than my life
darling, I'm sorry
love makes him cry
love whispers softly through the ears of our hearts
unrequited love
love your eyes uncle
love your eyes
your love is the light of glory
Your love really convinces me
Love also needs blessing. I'm strong enough
blown love
sibling love
the love that I carry with you
the love I carry
love that looks at wealth
love that comes from the heart will never die
love that is turbulent, far away, noisy and close, feels like it doesn't want to be separated
love that cannot be expected and only makes heartache
love that cannot be united
love that I can't get
love that I can't achieve
unspeakable love
love that broadcasts pluck
overflowing love
hindered love
love will find roots
My silent darling can pick you
Love? there is no such thing as love
love is unspoken so longing is in the heart
love can't separate us
love does not have to be reciprocated
inseparable love
love can't be bought with money
love requires commitment
love is a curse
love the resins
love does not have to have a position that is not important, what is important is certainty
love is like paper
love does not have to have a position, it is not important, what is important is certainty
love is from the deepest heart
darling, this grandfather's face is calm in heaven, yes, grandfather
First love doesn't start at first sight
first love he said
Love is also bought with money
darling, I want to have sex
forbidden love between me and you. because they were prevented from getting their parents' permission
forbidden love between me and you
one night love oh how beautiful
darling, when are we going on a trip?
Unfortunately, when I arrived at the upstream village, I saw that the guests had already gone home
darling is amazed
love sometimes whispers
love without parental blessing
love without being emotionally attached
love is blocked by blessing
Love will come by itself, no need to chase it
love always lulls
I love my lover, wait for me
His suffering love has no end
darling please turn on the camera
my darling..you must be strong..we will get through this all together
My darling swayed just waking up
My darling, sleep well
my round darling
my darling is concerned
My darling is as angry as you are
My darling, don't be afraid I will always be with you
My love

he is the fortress of my life
he is someone I really miss
he is someone I really miss
he defends dating officials!
He forgave me and set me free
he is harvesting rice
he is the older cousin of someone who is talkative in giving advice
she is not a Batak woman, but she is beautiful and kind
he is not your soul mate
she is beautiful but she once ruined my relationship
he's out
he can live quite well
He's handsome but I still glance at other men
she is a good, polite and beautiful girl. Thank You
she is a good, polite and beautiful girl
he immediately avoided a frowning smile
he fell during the race
he is not a hired shepherd
he was beaten by his father
he was told by officers not to smoke carelessly
he was seen more as a showpiece
where is he being treated?
he was detained by the police this afternoon
he was detained by the police
he and his sister fell asleep
he and his sister fell asleep
he wants you guys to get engaged
she wants to take me and wants to keep you away from this woman so that you
he wanted to reflect
he almost looks like my friend
he many things will depend on his own talent how he incorporates
he's a person like that
he's my boyfriend
he destroyed you
He thought because he was big, I was afraid of him
he thought I didn't understand
he's just a fried onion
he only dared to criticize
He just turned around for a moment then went to the other group
he only cared about his fate
he was just defending himself lightly
I caused him harm
he had the heart to sell to
Ã¢â¬Å" It turns out he has always had a close relationship with one of us
he looked at himself in the mirror
He wasn't angry, he just said that
he must accompany you
he got lost
he is a talkative person in giving advice
he is the owner
The older he gets, the wilder his lifestyle becomes
he cheated on me, I pinched his ear
he went to the market and washed his motorbike
he then passed the paper to the friend in front of him
he's tired of taking, I'm good at eating. also right in the ravine
he likes drinking
He is the person who plays the most role in my life

he was the friend who I considered a brother who stabbed me in the back
he is a great king
he split the crowd
he ordered
he turned off the computer so his brother got angry.
he looked away
he tied up the thief
he killed his best friend even though he still loved him
he laid me down in a field of green grass
he went straight to a good character
he immediately ran home
he has good customs
he snatched the money from my hand
he cursed his friend to come with him
he looked at me while playing with his eyes
he washed himself
he said it was late, just continue tomorrow
he wakes you up from a sweet dream
he glanced at the book in my hand
he deleted several answer choices then played with the pencil
he held a banquet with his students.
he took the initiative again
she wore a veil over her face
he invited me to walk
he designed small buildings for a very large fee
he expected the miracle to come
he paid great attention to several natural sciences
he paid great attention to several branches
he visited many tourist attractions
he thanks him for freeing him from the curse
he shivered in fear
he encouraged them to persevere and persevere through suffering. God promises
he retracted
he helps other people indiscriminately
he held his forehead with his left hand while his right hand scribbled
he rejected me the first time I tried to introduce myself
he regretted what had happened, but the rice had become porridge
he bought a teddy bear so his sister would feel happy.
he tapped both ends, then light slowly came out of the tube.
he defended himself
he's worth it
he tore the paper
he was interested in following the work he saw on the wall
he ran in the yard
he was as determined as steel
she lays very large eggs
did he mean to be sarcastic?
he ordered the servant
she prayed that he would not marry her
he died in the grave in the field
it's him
he played muddy like a child
he wandered everywhere but he never settled in one place.
He's cold when he's far away, but he's spoiled when he's close
he is Batak blood
he also tried swinging his legs
he is willing to sell to
he who is proud is he who brings down
He's the lucky one who looks ugly to me
he who gives he who takes
he prevented me
he told me to do that
He who lifts up does not mean leaving us below.
he wants to fight
he went to fifth grade and won the championship
He went to Citra yesterday
he is still married
She's already my wife, what's wrong with that?
He's very relaxed when facing you
he can't massage
he doesn't know who we are that's why he's trivial
he was not accompanied by his wife
he did not do his work even though he had been warned
he won't show up
he didn't want to shower first
He didn't move when I said that
he was practicing first
he's ugly
he had promised his enemy to meet
he just drank a little and immediately passed out
he asked because he didn't know the meaning, why did he ask back
he already wanted to tell us
he tidies things up
he cleaned the bamboo's eyes
he is jealous
he is still married
he is the perpetrator
he finished his task so quickly
he fainted
he explained the lesson to me because I didn't understand
he also gave his parents a better life
He had already called his mother
he is also firm in his principles
he's mine don't bother him
he was willing to do it even with a bad face
he's with you just an escape
he's with you, he's just an escape
he came with a promise and then left by breaking it
he's the one who feeds me
he then entered the crowd
he lacks anesthesia
She happened to be born in the dry season so her friends called her Putri
he would have been hanged had these results been discovered and then there had been a problem
He must regret leaving a woman as beautiful as me
he must always be in your imagination and your life
he looked about thirty years old.
he amazed himself
he was exhausted
he seemed eager to gain clear and real knowledge
he received his initial education at a national school
he is my best choice
he is always near you
he always came to the family house
he always came to the neighbor's house
he really didn't do anything that was disgraceful.
he is mine and I love him

is my dear sister
I don't usually call him his little brother by name because in terms of age I'm still young
I'll delete it later if I remember
he's so lively
namely, to never believe in accepting descriptions of people's personalities
Yes, I'm Batak Simalungun

Yes, I drink a lot
that's what you said earlier
it's just a rooster crowing

It's just that, even if there were, it wouldn't be like that
He was invited to a religious event
That's good. but there will be a shipping fee of two hundred dollars.

he also mixed his bath water with various fragrant flowers
So do humans, if they taste the pleasure of money or possessions too deeply

This is so that your ex will see you become prettier, so he will regret it
He was so disappointed, he didn't feel tears coming out of his eyelids
he was allowed to run

Yes, next time I will definitely invite my mother straight away
he really didn't want the slightest flaw on his body
he's a bit cold now
She was disappointed because she couldn't maintain her beauty
he looked confused for a moment
she always prided herself on her beauty
He seemed like he didn't care or wanted to help with the hassle

It's been a long time since you guys went to the party
it took a long time to learn
your movements have been slow for a long time
It's been a long time, when will it be finished?
for a long time like a child
It took a long time to work at the fort before I met fellow Batak people

I'd better stay away from you
I'd better listen
it's better to talk than to keep quiet
It's better to be angry using your own language
it is better to listen a lot than to talk a lot. Be careful in understanding
it's better if we drink healthy coffee
it's better for you to remove this thorn first.
It's better if you come back if you're bored
It's better to sit still than to be tired but not appreciated
it is better to lack hearing than to have no heart
It's better to take care of your life than someone else's life
It's better to rent a house, even if it's small, the important thing is to be happy without any disturbances
It is better for someone who rarely prays than to always worship all the time
it's better to leave than to be expelled
it is better to fish than to gamble and smoke
it's better to eat salted fish
it's better to speak modestly
better sun than dusk
it is better to die than to have your self-esteem trampled upon
better at first
it's better to back off than get hurt
It is better to live poor but honorable than rich but humiliated
better alone, than many two-faced friends
It's better to write everything in the agreement so it's clear
it is better to be poor than a disobedient child
it is better to be poor than disobedient
better is gold in someone else's land than stones in your own land
it is better to be exiled than to give in to hypocrisy.
It is better to be silent than to talk a lot which is useless
it's better to look brutal but have a sense of courtesy and honesty
better broken, than bent. That's the principle of our Batak people
better broken, than bent.

everything is just hope and wishful thinking
it's all just hope
it's all just hope..
everything is just an entrustment of power
everything is just a gift from God
I leave everything to God
I do everything just for the sake of the child
I missed everything
I took it all
All of this is the result of human negligence itself
all of that is provided by people. village

will not be shaken forever;
won't fall a second time
there won't be a long story going on
there is no work other than pulling out the beard
lasak
I won't be afraid and leave
there will never be peaceful humming
nothing can separate us
It's not appropriate if I think about it
not many people are wrapped around its size
A little
we're not that hard
you don't need to persuade me
No need to worry, your soul mate will definitely come
no need to care about me
no need to think too much
There's no need to come back again, if it will only cause heartache
it doesn't need to be bright and never fades in meaning
don't have money
I don't want it like that.
I don't want to fall anymore, I want to be successful
You're not safe when you cheat on me
You didn't survive when you cheated me,
you don't leave me for a second
not as special as you
There is nothing that can free humans from the wrath of God other than k

not only
No, it's still the same as learning
no
It's not that I'm stingy
It's not that I don't like the way you are, but I don't like your character
It's not that I don't love you anymore, it's just that I'm starting to realize myself
It's not like I forgot about you, because of the current difficult economic situation
don't you guys have a problem?
instead you are now in the field
Instead of working, I keep singing
not that it doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt, the moon doesn't break my heart,
not that it doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt, the moon doesn't break my heart,
not that it is necessary for the learning process

your child is already big
it's common to tie
It is common across the island of Kalimantan
I can do a little
That's good so you don't get confused later during the exam
I've been forced to do whatever I want
It would be easy if that were the case
It was already dark that day, soon there would be a cold
I've been tricked like that before, that's why I'm afraid
I've already talked about not seeing Padang girls for a day, it's a loss
I can't keep quiet anymore
I'm tired, you kind mother
You're smart, pig
You're smart enough to earn a lot of money
You seem to be fluent in Batak language
I think the rice is cooked
If you're old, don't be like a snotty child
If you're old, don't be like a snotty child
OK, let's just buy bread
I'm satisfied with seeing it
the item was damaged
you're ready to hear
every heart is raw
If you're old, don't be like a snotty child
This body is very tired
just tell me what that means
I want to get out, I swear
never mind, let's just wait... sit tight, okay?
Never mind, just take me home, it's late now
never mind, I don't know, so blame me
it's all wasted
you've got enough sleep tonight
never mind, come home here so that the tiredness in your heart will disappear
Never mind, it's already night, go to sleep quickly
let it go already
Just do whatever you like, darling
I'll just say hello politely
never mind, uncle, stop all this, no more hostility
That's enough. Don't be too serious this time

life is a competition
life is a journey that must be faced, not a problem to be afraid of.ÃÂ¢
Life is a struggle and struggle is life
life if there is no difficulty, there is no struggle
life is not waiting for the storm too but learning to search in the rain
life is not waiting for the storm to pass but learning to search in the rain
life is not waiting for the storm to pass but learning to dance in the rain
life is not a matter of comparison
Life is not just about carrying heavy burdens
my life is miserable
My life has moved from place to place
live godly
live in fear
live in God's justice and faithful love
living as a wanderer without direction and purpose
live simply and become generous
live peacefully and serenely
life is not about I can but also about me trying
life is not impossible
Life is to be lived, enjoyed and appreciated
life on wheels is not as beautiful as on thighs
live for progress
live to be free, not to be oppressed
live to serve
living amidst the loving arms of a million prominent fathers and mothers
living with one broken wing
live with principles, die with honor
live and rule together
life and teaching
prosperous and happy life
life is full of obstacles, achieve dreams for the future
life is full of deception
your life will not be peaceful and miserable for the rest of your life
our lives together
your life will not be peaceful for the rest of your life
life must still go on
My life is full of obstacles and many difficulties
My life is calmer if I don't take care of things that don't concern me
live in a fairy tale
Living in this world is not as easy as turning the palm of your hand
live in a fairy tale world
Life must be useful for other people
life is simple.... just live it, enjoy and be grateful for every process, whatever it is
life must be balanced
life must continue to be lived
Life must be enough, don't go into debt if you don't have money
life is getting bitter
living impact with the gospel
impactful life
human life compared to pig life
life thrives
live a life of faith and wisdom. Toba Batak language
Life begins with a dream
planning life is cool
live wisely, die faithful, live impudently, die by hand
live with me
live a peaceful life full of blessings
Your life is too dependent on other people
Life spins but when it spins it gets dizzy
life is so complicated
very boring life
life has begun to falter
You're tired of life and you're even dreaming that you're cheating on your coworker
I've lived a quarter of a century, I thank God
Life doesn't always give us what we want. unexpectedly, sometimes alive
life is out of balance
Life is no longer bitter as long as you understand coffee grounds
Life is lived, be grateful, just enjoy it
Life is to be lived and enjoyed
Life is about fighting, not taking it for granted
life means you have to fight
Life is beautiful... only your heart and mind make it cloudy
life is normal
life is hard my friend, what is soft is tough
life is like a wagon wheel
Life is sincere, just be sincere, don't complain too much
life has been destroyed by lust
Life is hard and soft is defecation
Life is not meaningless if the soul is separated from wise words
Life is not about comparison
this life is hard to live, it's easy to get through,
No, difficult problems that are important don't eliminate other humans
life is governed by money without money we can't do anything
life is governed by money without money the city can do nothing
This life is only short, so make your life useful
This life is too difficult for me to face
This life has rules
life is very tiring
Life is really complicated, isn't it?
this life is really cruel. only kind people understand
life is radiant, starting new
life is a journey not an escape so why do you run away
worker's life
I will give you life
life doesn't seem worth it
live together
lives a family who works as fishermen every day
live properly
live without stepping on your head
life without worship is like
hard life is always devalued
life is always humble
live like a weasel
live according to the flesh or the spirit?

what is that
it's because it's forced
the fathers dumped them
that's easy to say
That's the kid taking part in the boss's competition

Students are required to be able to analyze
Even the apostles who loved God had short lives
the apostles who love God

That man is just an entertainer in my heart
that's your national language
it's the language between a child and his father
that's listening to mom's advice
that's why I'm so happy here
that's why he brought all his possessions with him

live what is happening now
the ladies-in-waiting still look after it well
it's at the corner shop
so don't sell it expensively
it's a majestic and terrifying name.
That's called cowardice, because you just want to make people afraid
that's called cowardice
that's a lot of pigs in the line
that's his girlfriend
it must take priority
that's who holds the wood
there's something wrong with that
that's good, so you're thin, not like a pig
Batak people never fail
people don't realize they're being humiliated
that's a tough choice
ladies and gentlemen
Dear guests, good evening..
the attendees were all told
that's the total tax
that's what it's called
that's what's nice, cool and cool in the wind
I didn't use it as well as I could
that's the result you feel
that's what you think first
This covers and protects the knee joint
it curses
it immediately cursed
is it human or skull
it contains the truest philosophy
that is, if the question is done first then the key is only used as an appeal
it was a car filled with people who were gathering
that's what makes it narrow
Why are those black clothes closed?
that's the one in the bushes
that's the one near the shop
that's what drives us
Boss has paid for the red and black ones
it will appear by itself
they are more than vile and very evil people
That's already paid, boss, don't be noisy
that was his will
it has become the obligation of the people
We usually do that every day while playing dominoes
, it's not guaranteed that I'll get along with everyone
Grandpa is watching us
that's grandpa is watching us
that's just a good cock
that's your chin, okay?
that's how you feel
that's spicy
it means a lot to you because he knows your situation best
it is very funny
listeners who are based on good soil
that's a belief opinion
contemporary experts also suspect
contemporary experts also discuss
interpreters
that's what people say now
dollar seekers
the nomads

it is an ark of safety for anxious people
the fishermen are catching lots of fish
it leads to the fields
Scientist
that's language
the residents wore beautiful clothes
the drunkards

it's a forest bird
That's my face, you stole it, okay?
it needs to be built
that's the essence of the lives of these Batak people
that's your famous album
that's the member
it's a water tube
that's all you know
that's all that was asked
that's the way of clever people
that's the way
the rulers laughed and the greedy grew richer
It's your duty to teach me

ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã...âº right now I'm thinking about what makes me happy, the rest I don't care ÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬
I currently work in my father's office as a lawyer
Today we celebrate the anniversary of the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ
At this time the house was empty
Right now all I need is solitude without anyone bothering me
Currently, your duties as an elder are increasing
for now let me be alone
currently at eighty-five% in delinquency
Nowadays it turns out to have a bad impact on the environment
. At this time of course I can resist a touch
during an orderly inspection of the school by picket teachers and administrators
the last time I held your hand
as it spreads its wings and leaves its nest
it's time for us to rebel
It's time for you to show who you are
It's time to visit Medan city
when it all started tonight it rained again
when the heat is up, luck is not on your side
When I'm far away I can't sleep soundly
when it turned out that my father didn't come to pick me up
When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with your elbows folded
when you find out that one of the children is far from what you expected

Rather than being destroyed, it's better to retreat
Instead of loving me, you're better off looking for a new one
after a long time I died in torment
Instead of herding buffalo, it's better to just herd your heart
Instead of being sad, let's dance
Instead of getting dizzy, it's nice to dance
rather than not swaying
instead of being confused, it's good to dance
rather than looking like monkey snot
instead of making it difficult for us to dance
rather than my family being threatened

You've known from the start that his heart is rotten
I was just joking, my brother knew his sister was feeling down
it's just been noisy since then
Since then I've been talking to my sister's boyfriend
I've been suspicious ever since
He had been joking ever since, because he knew his little brother was feeling down

Silence is a true friend who never betrays
Being silent doesn't mean accepting, it just means being reluctant to say something.
Shut up, I'll step on your feet
Shut up and your mouth will bleed
Shut your mouth, rat
shut up your mouth is a corpse
Shut up, disgusting bitch
Shut up, I'll slam you one by one
Shut up, you disobedient child
Shut up, your words are not good
Shut up you Chinese dog

Shut up, I'll turn it off later

maybe this longing is paid for by love
maybe there are obstacles
Maybe it's because my heart is short of thinking about you
maybe it's not me who makes you comfortable
maybe not now but you will definitely know that we are in the same womb
maybe I just need to learn the parts I often forget
maybe I'm too selfish
maybe I'll be wasted
maybe I'm not perfect
Maybe to him I don't matter so much that the night of change will be passed
maybe it was stolen by the devil
Maybe it's only when I die that you care
Maybe this way I can forget you
maybe the surprise still lingers in your mind
Maybe I'm going home on the twentieth
maybe the twentieth
maybe a lot of money
Maybe you're busy getting ready to go to the airport
maybe you are busy getting ready to leave
Maybe you don't want to be with him all the time
Maybe I'm the only one who prefers to defend my family rather than my partner. Because
Maybe it's only temporarily that I can forget you
maybe he is better than me
maybe he still wants to try to prove it
maybe he doesn't have a quota
Maybe the cruel friendship is too innocent for me

maybe collect a debt of gratitude
maybe what makes us still left behind in heaven
Maybe it's fate that you two have to separate
maybe not, going home is not allowed by the government
maybe you haven't eaten enough
maybe my life is no longer useful
maybe it is the name of a hidden god
Maybe that's what I can tell you about the area where I live
Maybe this is my karma that you gave me, God
maybe a crocodile could enter
maybe a fan
maybe our relationship has cracked
