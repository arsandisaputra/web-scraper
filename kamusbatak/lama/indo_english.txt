I surrender and you love
I spend more time at the office all day
I'm a party hose

I now love you, come back with me now darling
I'm having trouble sleeping again
I'm so scared of dogs
I'm getting more and more confused with you
I'm at school Monday
I've just called you and it's been very difficult for you to contact me
I'm from the Sihaloho clan
I miss dad I want to see him
I miss the beauty of space
I miss you, don't forget about us, okay?

I had a meeting in front of my sister-in-law
I didn't fit last month
I'm not a daughter of the Nababan clan
I am a type of tree whose sap is blood red in the city of Medan
I'm safe this song
I, without you, Mama, am just a human who is not ready to be human
I was born in Urai

I wish I knew what a man says to a woman's sibling
I'm uncomfortable reading it
I regret my behavior
I'm sorry I wasted your time
I realize that there are other people who are more worthy of you
I'm hungry
I definitely have the right to have you
I don't think I'm your pleasure anymore
I guess I'm not your pleasure still
I may not include you
I'm related to you
I'm disappointed that you have changed when you make new friends
I hope to get to know you better
I hope you are the last human being I have
I am strong
I always make noise because I'm a coward
I still pray for a more beautiful person in my husband
I still hope that we promised not to forget that time, brother
I still make noise because I'm a coward
I'm going to your party
I was born for a noble purpose
I'll let it all go if it's true
I'll let it all go if I'm not the one you want
I thought the groin was swollen

If it's understandable, I'm saying that the moon, the full moon, is chosen because I'm in your bed to keep your heart safe.
If anyone dares to get caught in the sap, I will greet the mother with respect and affection
If only that could be understood by the full moon of the month
If only that could be understood by the full moon of the month
if you eat it there is still a price
if only it was still there
If only it were possible for the boat to be calm outside
If only I could understand it and reach me
if only I knew
If only I knew how men greet their sisters
If I had wings, I would be like an eagle that would fly every moment, would I come, my real mother, let me miss you
if only it were understood
I wish I could understand my longing for you
if you guessed it
If you can guess what the purpose of our request is
if only and what would be wrong if you don't get married
if only and what would be wrong if you don't get married
If it's not wrong if I don't get married, I really won't get married until I'm old

I wish you knew that I want to have you
I hope you know that I want to have you as my companion
if you think you are marrying a man
if you really think you're going to marry a man
If you think about marrying a man, it's really too late
If you think there is no longer a girl who fills your heart
if you suspect that your feces have been eaten by pigs
If you write, it's not wrong if you don't say yes
If you don't write it all down if you don't say yes
if you don't serve it to you
if you don't do it, don't do it

We
we face everything and smile
we don't have any advantages
we start this game and we follow where it goes
we are kept away from places of danger, especially disease
we are on the verge of parting
we're quiet
we are the introduction
we'll do it now, we'll do it the day after tomorrow
we are now, we are married, and we will be the day after tomorrow
We'll see who goes and the wheel spins, you wait
we must be steadfast, our hearts
we must be discouraged
We sat and relaxed in the evening at the Batak sub-ethnic lake while enjoying the sunset
Where are we going now my wife?
We're rarely brothers-in-law
we are united and friends
we parted from that agreement
we remind each other
we tried to wait a very long time
those of us who lack a church assembly
two of us together, one seat together is safe
we are the ones who take care of other destructive humans
we will be reminded when he leaves
we are friends with the ghost who owns it
We haven't started class yet, right?
We haven't started class yet, right?
we do not know each other yet

let's keep quiet
let's finish the conversation
let's finish this conversation
Let's finish it well so that there is no hate in our hearts
we firmly have internal advantages
we keep forgetting promises that we should remember and remembering promises that are actually not important
We certainly have advantages in that

you're a flea
You clean the dishes first, that's the hard part
You expressed your response to what a man has experienced when greeting a woman's sibling. Your words shocked everyone

You want to have someone who is loyal but you are not loyal and are blinded by money
You want to have loyal friends but you are not loyal because you are blinded by money

you salute the weasel
You succeeded in making me fall in love, my Batak
Have you ever felt like you're going through an annoying day?

Do you think you're that great? You're crazy
You think it's good to mock other humans
you're tough
you can convince too little
where are you, I miss you, darling, come back, don't hang up on this relationship
where are you eating?
You were a bit angry just now
You have to be patient with him because you are different
Who are you to help monkeys?
you are a greeting from a man to a brother or sister, a hundred dear
You will meet me as long as the net will not part, it is understood that you promise to support me
You approach him if he wants me to try to let him go, it makes you
You go first, your friend

What are you doing darling?
You're beautiful too, don't forget to be grateful
you are also a bad series
You tried to leave this world to release my father
You're the one I'm fighting for
You are the one I love, continue to be with me, a word of guidance to make sure
You are the one who makes people hurt and even you are the one who feels hurt
you are unclean
You are the one who starts and you are the one who ends
You are the one who started, you have to finish, don't be a coward because love will not know you
you changed everything
you are the one who means it
You were the one who made me like this in the first place
You are crazy and even exceed the limits of eligibility
You shouldn't be like that
you will be safe, warm and leave for a moment all the burdens in your life when you are near and with him, the same when you are sick and it is time for you to die, you will be calm in his arms
you are mine alone
you're still scared
Have you eaten yet, friend? Don't eat too late or you'll get sick
Have you done your assignment yet?
Have you studied yet?
you have eaten
are you home yet?
You already told your father about yesterday
you're not clear
you don't bother me back
You're not afraid of him cheating
you don't know anything
You don't deserve to be called a human if you have a heart like a ghost
You don't know how painful it is to fight alone and the pain of hope

You're still not cooked
You still haven't showered
You haven't showered yet, have you?
You haven't left yet

Only the daughters of the Manurung clan of the Sirait clan ask for a little of the harvest
only girls from the Pasaribu clan and the combination of the three colors of black, red and white thread is right
just no money I understand
only God can release, others no longer exist
only on the lips of who believes
just by sticking to each other sticking to each other mothers
It's all just wishful thinking
only the words of the people who lead the traditional Batak drum music are sounded
Are you just saying all the protocols in vain?
I just accept that's what you say
I just want to make rules
Our only two games are ahead
It's just a lie when you talk about what men say to women's siblings
just want to let go
just want to let go of the longing and
I just want to have a fake relationship, then I like it and intend to be friends for life forever
It's just a democratic party in name

It's just that all these humans are absent-minded, I'm generous

Only small children learn to speak, right?
I'm just following what people say
just helping friends, no one helps me
only that burns in
